<p>  <hr size =10>I am a hard working, resiliant and profesional individual.Team work and upward mobility are a few things that i prioritize as i belive in persistence. My skills and expertise is more than enough to excicue any tasks given to me while on the job. Having the opportunity to intern at two amazing companies has taught me some valuable lessons and very important ethical norms of the workplace. The need for improvement is also at the top if my priority list as i always see the importance of bettering my self and my knowledge.<br>
<p>Outside of the workplace i often work on my brand PURE Clothing. 
I use my graphic design skills and create garments that i resell. My social media management expertise are also put to use as it is my main medium of communication.<br>
